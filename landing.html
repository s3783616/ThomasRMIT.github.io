										<h2>Who am I? </h2>
									</header>
									<p>My name is Thomas Jukes, Student number S3783616. My email is s3783616@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Australia, but I'm a dual citizen, Britain being where I grew up. I graduated secondary school at Wesley College (SKR). I'm a huge fan of Tabletop Roleplaying Games, own a cat named Lilly; and eventually want to take over the world.</p>

												<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I've always been interested in IT. It's such a huge part of our lives, and many people, businesses and even governments depend on it. And it's growing. It's an ever expanding field; and it will become more and more impressive as technology keeps developing. I'm personally interested in delving into the world of cybersecurity, protecting various clients from intrusion. I'm inexperienced, but I'm eager to learn. And that's exactly why I went into RMIT. I hope to learn about the basics of computers, how to code, and eventually, how to get into cybersecurity.</p>

												<h3>The Ideal Job</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My ideal job is either a security consultant for a corporation, a freelance pentester, or a spy. ASIS has a job called an "Operations Technology Officer". In this job, one applies their technical skills and expertise to help Australian Intelligence in their operations. The reason it appeals to me is because I can help people, (and also be a spy. I mean, who doesn't want to be a spy?) <br /> <br /> Given the nature of the work, I'll need to be flexible, able to innovate; and *very* driven. I'll need to be able to work with people; developing superior interpersonal and liasoning skills. I need to develop my charisma, being able to work effectively with people from other countries and cultures. I've got to get good risk assessment skills, and manage myself maturely. Not to mention, a 3 year university degree. <br /> <br /> I've got a long way to go. I can work with people pretty easily, but perhaps not to the level that ASIS requires. I plan to learn all I can through RMIT, be it cybersecurity, working with others through course projects and the like; and growing as a person. More information about the job can be found here: https://www.asis.gov.au/Careers/Roles-and-Vacancies/Technologist/Profile.html </p>

												<h3>My Personality Profile</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My Myers-Briggs Test gives me the result of an ENTJ-A, or 'Commander'. It gives me a good indication as to my personality type. Working in a team is a specialty of ENTJs, but knowing the results in and of itself won't influence my behaviour. I won't need to take my results into account when working in a team, beyond predicting what situations I'll be comfortable in. <br /> <br /> As for the online learning styles test, the results indicate that I'm a visual learner. This means little to me, I must admit. It doesn't really effect my behaviour in a team, and I don't think should be taken into account. <br /> <br /> I did the "Dark Triad personality test" and my results ended up with 2.9 Machiavellianism, 2.1 Narcissism, and 1.8 Psychopathy. This means little to me, but it's interesting to see how much of me is manipulative. But hey, that's a good thing in the corporate world, right? I don't think it affects how I'd work in a work in a team. </p>

										<h2>Project</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I aim to increase security for systems and users. It will be a program that will defend a system from intrusion, stop personal data from being mined by websites; and educate the user to be more wary of social engineering attempts. This project will help me gain insight and knowledge into the field of cybersecurity and machine learning; as well as getting me acquainted with the social engineering aspect of the profession. Through this, I'll have some of the necessary skills to join ASIS, and protect against intrusion by hostile parties. It shall be called... STEVE <br /> <br />
Information privacy, and protecting against surveillance is becoming an increasing concern nowadays. With so many websites taking data from their users, and corporations and governments spying on the people for their own sinister purposes; I feel that there must be something protecting society's data from being manipulated for evil purposes. I vow to create this shield! Machine Learning seems like a good way for a computer to recognise attacks, and react in programmed ways to counter-act them. It's also an interesting approach to the problem! <br /> <br />
The program will be equipped with a library of known scams and tactics, as well as the ability to recognise them, and alert the user to what the detected intrusion attempt is doing, and provide instruction on how to stop it. It will also have the ability to scan any page, form or application that requires the user give their personal data to. If STEVE finds certain issues with the page in question, such as bad grammar or references to international banks such as Western Union; it will alert the user. <br /> <br />
It will be difficult to make it work with the accuracy that I want, detecting the threats and warning the user; but that's not it's only function. It educates the user on the common tactics used by social engineers and phishers. <br /> <br />
On the design side, it should be user friendly, as making security accessible is a major part of why I want to make STEVE. If the user can't *use* it, then the project has failed before it's begun. It will contain a library of common tactics and schemes that scammers, companies, and governments use to obtain personal information, and what they do with it. This should be easy to read and understand. My goal is to educate users to question whether or not they should trust something with their data. That is impossible if they don't understand what they should be on the lookout for. STEVE can only do so much; and although I want it to defend against everything, it should eventually fall to the user to determine what they trust, or don't trust. STEVE will warn the user, and stop malware from being executed, but the user always makes the decision to trust.
STEVE, as an app, could run on a computer or smartphone. Since it's software, I imagine the actual code will be all that's required, so long as it has something to run on. I'll need something to create it with though, perhaps using a programming language like C++ <br /> <br />
I'll need to learn a lot about how data is gathered, how and why it can be used maliciously, and compile that in an easy-to-read, educational format. Machine learning is a complicated subject, which I know nothing about. I've also got to learn a coding language fluently. Thus, I must learn about that too. As for feasibility, it's a great deal of complicated topics to cover, but I imagine I can do it. Eventually. Give or take 5 years. <br /> <br />
If STEVE has the impact I intend, society will become more security conscious, both online and offline. Their data will be secure, at least until people inevitably come up with cleverer and more refined tactics. Companies will have their information stolen less, governments will have a more security conscious workforce, preventing hacks and leaks, and the general public will enjoy a life with a lessened risk of having their data stolen.
